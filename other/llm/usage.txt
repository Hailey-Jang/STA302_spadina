If you are encountering issues or need guidance on how to proceed with XeTeX or R Markdown, here are a few general points and tips:

Knitting R Markdown: When you knit an R Markdown document in RStudio that includes LaTeX content, it typically calls a typesetting engine like XeTeX to compile the document into a PDF. The knitting process converts the Markdown content and embedded R code into a LaTeX document, which is then compiled by the typesetting engine.

Error Handling: If there's an error during the knitting process, RStudio's console or the log file generated by XeTeX will usually provide details. These messages are crucial for troubleshooting, as they often pinpoint exactly where and why the knitting process failed.
